# **2016 US Bike Share Activity**

## Introduction
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles for short trips, typically 30 minutes or less. Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

In this project, I will perform an exploratory analysis on data provided by <a href="https://www.motivateco.com/">Motivate</a>, a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States. I will compare the system usage between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. I will also see if there are any differences within each system for those users that are registered, regular users and those users that are short-term, casual users.

## Data Collection and Wrangling
In this project, we will focus on the record of individual trips taken in 2016 from our selected cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. Each of these cities has a page where we can freely download the trip data.:
